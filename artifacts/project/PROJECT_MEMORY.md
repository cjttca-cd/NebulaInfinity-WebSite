# PROJECT_MEMORY — NebulaInfinity Website

## Now
- Setting up spec-driven artifacts structure (OS v1)

## Next

## Decisions
| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 2025-07-17 | Adopt OS v1 artifacts structure | Standardize feature delivery with Patch (light) vs Feature (heavy) workflow |
| 2025-07-17 | Epic: `website-redesign` | Umbrella for transforming dark Linear-style → clean light professional |
| 2025-07-17 | First feature: `design-tokens-migration` | Foundation — must land before any component work |
